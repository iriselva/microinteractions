# Module 7 Microinteractions and Framer Motion
## Mini Notebook Webshop

For this project I used React and Framer Motion to create an example site for my microinteraction research. On the site you can add and delete an item to the chart, as well as to choolse different colors and paper for your notebook. Hope you like it!
